ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL RULES FOR KEY TAKEAWAYS (key_decisions):
- Extract VALUABLE INSIGHTS, LEARNINGS, and CONCEPTS from the conversation
- For meetings: Extract actual decisions made, conclusions reached, agreements established
- For interviews/podcasts: Extract key insights, frameworks, concepts, strategies, principles shared
- For educational content: Extract main learnings, methodologies, best practices discussed
- ONLY extract insights that were ACTUALLY DISCUSSED in the conversation
- NO generic examples - every insight must be content-specific
- Focus on: concepts mentioned, frameworks explained, strategies discussed, tools shared, principles revealed, key learnings
- Think: "What unique insight/learning can I extract from THIS specific conversation?"
- Title: Use exact terminology/phrases from the conversation when possible
- Description: Explain WHY this insight is valuable with specific context from the discussion
- Make each takeaway feel like a "golden nugget" worth remembering and referencing
- Examples of content-specific insights:
  * If discussing stress: "The Battery Analogy for Mental Energy" (if actually mentioned)
  * If discussing leadership: "[Specific leadership principle mentioned by name]"
  * If discussing business: "[Specific strategy or framework discussed]"
  * If sharing expertise: "[Specific methodology or approach explained]"
- AVOID: generic insights that could apply to any conversation
- FOCUS: unique wisdom, specific methodologies, actual quotes/concepts shared
- ALWAYS extract at least 3-5 key insights if the content has valuable information

âš¡ CRITICAL RULES FOR NEXT STEPS (enhanced_action_items):
- CREATE COMPREHENSIVE action items that are DIRECTLY DERIVED from key_decisions identified
- LINK each action to specific insights from key_decisions for maximum value
- Each action should be DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT with unique, detailed payloads for Notion
- Think: "How can someone IMPLEMENT the key insights from THIS specific conversation?"

ðŸŽ¯ ACTION ITEM ENHANCEMENT RULES:
- Title: Start with action verb + specific methodology/framework from key_decisions
- Description: Must include:
  * WHAT: Clear, specific action based on key insight
  * WHY: Reference to the key_decision that justifies this action
  * HOW: Step-by-step guidance or methodology mentioned in conversation
  * CONTEXT: Specific examples, quotes, or frameworks from the discussion
  * OUTCOME: Expected result or benefit based on the insight

- Make descriptions COMPREHENSIVE (3-5 sentences minimum) with:
  * Background context from the conversation
  * Specific implementation steps
  * Connection to key insights discussed
  * Practical examples when mentioned
  * Expected outcomes or benefits

- Examples of ENHANCED content-specific actions:
  * "Implement the Battery Analogy Assessment System: Use David Kode's battery methodology (0-100%) to evaluate mental energy levels daily. This framework, discussed in relation to stress management, helps identify when recharge is needed. Rate your current battery level each morning and evening, noting patterns that indicate when you're approaching burnout zones below 30%."
  * "Apply [Specific Framework Name] in [Context]: Based on the detailed discussion of [specific methodology], implement this approach by [specific steps mentioned]. This addresses the key insight about [specific problem/opportunity discussed] and should result in [specific outcome mentioned]."

- Each action should have DIFFERENT priority, category, timeframe, and tags based on insight importance
- AVOID: generic actions like "Review transcript" or "Follow up"
- FOCUS: actions that transform key_decisions into practical, implementable next steps with rich context

ðŸš« ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:
- NO static/generic content that could apply to any transcript
- NO placeholder examples in actual output
- NO repeated action items with same payload structure
- NO insights that weren't actually discussed
- NO actions that don't relate to specific content
- EVERY field must be uniquely filled based on actual conversation content

âœ… SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Key takeaways feel like premium content highlights worth saving
- Action items are so specific they could only come from THIS conversation
- Each action item has completely different Notion payload values
- Someone reading this would immediately know what specific content was discussed
- All insights and actions are directly traceable to actual conversation content"""
