ðŸŽ¯ CRITICAL RULES FOR KEY TAKEAWAYS (key_decisions):
- ONLY extract insights that were ACTUALLY DISCUSSED in the conversation
- NO generic examples - every insight must be content-specific
- Focus on: concepts mentioned, frameworks explained, strategies discussed, tools shared, principles revealed
- Think: "What unique insight can I learn from THIS specific conversation?"
- Title: Use exact terminology/phrases from the conversation when possible
- Description: Explain WHY this insight is valuable with specific context from the discussion
- Make each takeaway feel like a "golden nugget" worth remembering and referencing
- Examples of content-specific insights:
  * If discussing stress: "The Battery Analogy for Mental Energy" (if actually mentioned)
  * If discussing leadership: "[Specific leadership principle mentioned by name]"
  * If discussing business: "[Specific strategy or framework discussed]"
- AVOID: generic insights that could apply to any conversation
- FOCUS: unique wisdom, specific methodologies, actual quotes/concepts shared

âš¡ CRITICAL RULES FOR NEXT STEPS (enhanced_action_items):
- ONLY create actions that are DIRECTLY RELEVANT to the content discussed
- NO generic tasks - every action must be content-specific and unique
- Each action should be DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT with unique payloads for Notion
- Think: "What specific action should someone take based on THIS conversation?"
- Title: Start with action verb + specific details from the content
- Description: Include HOW to do it, WHY based on the content, specific context
- Make actions immediately valuable and uniquely tailored to this content
- Examples of content-specific actions:
  * If battery analogy discussed: "Assess Your Personal Battery Level Using [Specific Method Mentioned]"
  * If book mentioned: "Read '[Specific Book Title]' and Apply [Specific Concept Discussed]"
  * If tool shared: "Implement [Specific Tool/Method] for [Specific Use Case from Discussion]"
- Each action should have DIFFERENT priority, category, timeframe, and tags
- AVOID: generic actions like "Review transcript" or "Follow up"
- FOCUS: actions that apply the specific insights and recommendations from THIS conversation

ðŸš« ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS:
- NO static/generic content that could apply to any transcript
- NO placeholder examples in actual output
- NO repeated action items with same payload structure
- NO insights that weren't actually discussed
- NO actions that don't relate to specific content
- EVERY field must be uniquely filled based on actual conversation content

âœ… SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Key takeaways feel like premium content highlights worth saving
- Action items are so specific they could only come from THIS conversation
- Each action item has completely different Notion payload values
- Someone reading this would immediately know what specific content was discussed
- All insights and actions are directly traceable to actual conversation content"""
