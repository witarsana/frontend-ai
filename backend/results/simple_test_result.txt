TRANSCRIPTION TEXT:
--------------------
I'm talking to Alguir Thomas, the top of the scientist. In the universe, ever professed Neil DeGrasse Tyson, who's new, but just to do a bit of media sensationism, and Neil, is new book. To infinity and beyond is out this month. It's absolutely riveting. You write about this stuff so brilliantly. You bring it all so alive. And I'm really going to go into a few things. But first of all, the key question for me with all this. But I'm such a really young book. How much do you think we know? And how much do you think we don't know about what's out there? That's a great question. And I can actually quantify that answer. So there's these things, this dark matter you might have heard about. So dark matter is 85% is responsible for 85% of the gravity in the universe. And we have no idea what it is, but we can measure it. There's dark energy responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe. We can measure that, but we don't know what's causing it. And then you add up all of these sort of, what these forces are doing in the universe, it's 96% of what's driving the universe. And all the forces of nature that we know and love, gravity, electromagnetism, the strong and weak nuclear forces, life, chemistry, biology, physics. That's in 4% of the universe. So we know enough about the universe to quantify our ignorance. So we know 4% of what's going on out there. But also keep in mind that as the area of our knowledge grows, so too does the perimeter of our ignorance. And that is the very soul of science, that there are questions, people say, what questions do you want answered? Yeah, I don't think that way. I think what question do I not even yet know this? I think that's the really, because part is that you're probably not even thinking of the great question, right? Because there may be something correct. That's, I lose sleep over that, yes. No, I know you're an avowed atheist. How can you be so certain that there is no supernatural, godlike entity out there, given that we know so little? Well, first, I don't count myself among the ranks of avowed atheists. And I'll tell you, I give a fast example why. A friend of mine went up to fix the Hubble telescope, okay, on the Space Shuttle. And on my Facebook feed, I said, Godspeed to the Space Shuttle astronauts. And then in the comments, I thought you were an atheist. How could you possibly say that? And so the fact that I briefly said that and atheists complained about it, clearly I'm not an atheist. Well, my favorite Broadway musical of all time is Jesus Christ Superstar, which I saw in real time in New York City. I don't know that atheists care. So I don't want to go. So is there a God- I'm not kneeling to God's title. I'll be your bat's, I have a break. I don't know. Is there a God? Okay. What so I will tell you is that there are a lot of unknowns in the universe. But just because there are unknowns, does not mean there's a deity in the unknown. If you're gonna decide to be in the reason. That, which, it doesn't mean there isn't. That's correct. So you're more of a human mind about this, right? Everyone should. If the unknown is the unknown. But the track record of people saying, God is behind this and then you add a little science to it and you find out, that we can completely explain it and control it. Then the history of that exercise is so rich with science discovering the unknowns that were previously described to deity, like lightning bolts and weather systems. There was Poseidon. There was Zeus. There was just look at the history of this. I'm not given reason to say, we're gonna find something. God is gonna be at the center of that and there'll be no science to apply. I'm gonna look for the science first because that's how the history of this exercise is unfolded. Let me put you a clip. This is you talking to Joe Rogan about vegans. You wanna say, Vanuamals. I've never seen anyone say, save the leeches. No, no one cares about bugs. Save the ticks and you can ask if you really into animals and don't wanna kill them, if you heard that ticks were endangered, would you start a movement to protect ticks? Would you do that? And if you would, a more power to you, but I'm thinking you're not. They're not, it's the little guys they don't care about. I've had this debate with vegans. I won last week, I have it every month. And I was pointing out, most vegans I know months away on almonds and avocados and they turn a blind eye to the fact that this causes the mass murder of billions of bees, mainly in California. They don't wanna have that debate because I don't care about the little guys, Neil. But only reaction there is. That comment was addressing only vegans who are vegans because they don't wanna kill animals. That's not a great. Other reasons to be vegan. Of course. Of course. I'm so excited to see you. The ones who run into steak cows is playing sounds of cows being slaughtered. They're the ones that much avocados and almonds. Invariably. Yeah, and by the way, and they are dining upon the reproductive organs of plants. They're kind of weird. And I imagine if a plant-based alien visited earth, they would freak out when they saw vegetarians. Because the vegetarians would be eating them, right? And vegetarian's target, not only the reproductive organs, the nuts, the berries, the flowers, but they also target the infant versions of it. With baby lettuce, baby carrots, baby, my goodness. This would terrify a plant-based alien. So that's just a cosmic perspective on that. No, no, you give me, you have given me a whole new line of attack. The flower babies, I love it. This is fantastic. I just, they find, that's the way, that's dangerous. It's dangerous to feed you more lines of attack. Because I don't know what you're going to do with it. Well, I always like to take these things to their logic alone, right? And it seems to me that when it suits them, they care about the bigger animals, the cuddly ones. But when it comes to the little guys, they're not interested. Now, what are talking about? You're afraid the furry ones, especially. Some even more iconic, actually, the god-al-vegans. And it's your moustache, which has become one of the world's most famous moustaches. And he's extraordinarily as a whole website. This has been set up called DeGrasse Tyson's Moustache. And we did a bit of research ourselves, but a scientific research. And there's a moustache montage that we have here, which is quite extraordinary. It turns out almost every brilliant scientist has had a magnificent touch. Nicola Tesla, the inventor, extraordinaire, great-tash, Louis de Broglie, the discover the wavelength nature of all matter, great-tash. Hans Geiger, famous for the Geiger counter. Robert H. Goddard built the first liquid field rocket. And of course, Albert Einstein, probably the one nearest to your own. You've become the modern day godfather of science moustaches, but very much running in a sort of great, long historic list of great taches. I never thought about it. This moustache I've never shaved it in my life. Yes, I've trimmed it, but it's, ever since I could grow a moustache, I've had a moustache. So it's just part of my life. And even it was kind of out of style a few years ago. And I was a little bit, I did get rid of my munch-up sideburns. I figured, okay, that's from 1978. I could lose those, but I did keep the moustache. But if I were to vote among those moustaches, I would say, you know, we remember Einstein is this wire-haired gray, big bushy eyebrows, but he was a dashing young man. And he was a human-a-tuxedo. Oh, yes, look at that moustache. That's like a magnum PI moustache. I can't even... You could, fun a question. And if you could have dinner tonight with any scientist in the history of recorded mankind, it would be. Yeah, it would be no question about it, Isaac Newton. But I think about that all the time, and I'd say, Isaac come for dinner and he'd look out the window and he sees these things moving. He said, what are those? And I'd say, well, they're horse-drawn carriages without a horse. He said, well, how do they move? Well, they use gasoline. What's gasoline? What's fossil fuels? What's fossil fuels? And after five minutes of it, I'd say, go back to the cavefront. Oh, so unfortunately, your answer. It's so much that it's happened since then. Well, you're asking. I can tell you if I have the patience. When you killed my fairy, also, because I was in famous he was clean-shaven. Oh. Well, Newton, we see him with these big locks of her curls. But I think that was actually a wig on top of much shorter hair. And the statue of him in Cambridge, at Trinity and church in Cambridge, you see him with short hair. Wow. So I was so disappointed when I heard of that. Yeah. Neil, I could, honestly, interview every single day. And it would never get boring. You've got a fantastic way of bringing this stuff to life. To infinity and beyond, a journey of cosmic discovery, Neil deGrasse Tyson and then Zywalka. It's a number one New York Times best seller. As all your books are, it's a fantastic reading. Great to have you. I can, on sense. Thank you.
